I have made two chronology plot with R code for Polylepis tarapacana (δ¹⁸O)  and  Fitzroya cupressoides (δ¹³C). the columns of the data sets are Year and Chronology. Mean annual value has been depicted with dark line, and shaded area are represented by the 95th and 5th percentiles. Dotted line represents linear trends (linear regression) of isotopic records. No sample depth here. Also added panels.
